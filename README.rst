setr - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Ranges
------------------------------------------

A grab bag of better ranges for Python projects.

Is it good?
===========

It will be good soon.

TODOs
=====

1. Allow MultiRange not to need to sort after ever addition.
 - A function that requires sorting should check a boolean value and sort if nec.
