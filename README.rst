setr - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Ranges
------------------------------------------

A grab bag of better ranges for Python projects.

Is it good?
===========

Yup, but it is small.

Installation
============

` pip install setr `

TODOs
=====

1. Allow MultiRange not to need to sort after ever addition.
 - A function that requires sorting should check a boolean value and sort if nec.
2. Create an iter for MultiRange.
3. Create BigRange.
4. Allow the use of steps.
5. Think about implementing a __sum__.
6. Add examples in this README.
