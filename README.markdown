setr - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Ranges
------------------------------------------

A grab bag of better ranges for Python projects.

Is it good?
===========

I'm refactoring it from my copy and paste hatched jobs, so while it has, 
in some form been used in production, it hasn't been tested or checked for
edge cases.

It will be good soon though.
